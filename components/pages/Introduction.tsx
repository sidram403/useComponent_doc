         useComponents is a collection of free-to-use React components built with Tailwind CSS. This is not a library, but rather a 
          resource where you can preview components and copy the code for use in your own projects. 
        </p> 
        <p className="text-lg mb-4"> 
          Feel free to explore the different categories of components in the sidebar. Each component comes with a preview and 
          the corresponding code, which you can easily copy and integrate into your project.

          We'll be continuously updating and adding more components, so check back often for new additions!
